# Learning Clojure

I was introduced to Clojure in university during classes of the Programming Paradigms subject. By then, I found it very complicated and now I've decided to try to learn it, since my only exposure to programming until now was to the object-oriented paradigm. Getting familiar with the functional paradigm sounded like fun.

I've been following the guide on [Brave Clojure](https://www.braveclojure.com/). Through that I was also exposed for the first time to Emacs, and I found it amazing!
